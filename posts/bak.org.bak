* What is Leigh Syndrome?
Leigh Syndrome, also known as subacute necrotizing encephalopathy, is a rare and progressive genetic disorder that affects the central nervous system, specifically the brainstem and basal ganglia. It is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA that disrupt the normal functioning of cells, particularly those involved in energy production (Rahman & Copeland, 2019).

* Who is affected by Leigh Syndrome?
Leigh Syndrome can affect individuals of any age and gender, but it is most commonly diagnosed in infants and young children.

* What are the symptoms of Leigh Syndrome?
The symptoms of Leigh Syndrome can vary widely from person to person, but they typically include poor appetite, vomiting, seizures, muscle weakness, and problems with movement and breathing. Other symptoms may include vision and hearing loss, heart problems, and developmental delays.

* How is Leigh Syndrome diagnosed?
Diagnosis of Leigh Syndrome usually involves a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging tests such as MRI scans, and genetic testing to identify the mutations responsible for the disease. Other laboratory tests may also be performed to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms (Leigh Syndrome Foundation, n.d.).

* How is Leigh Syndrome managed or treated?
At present, there is no cure for Leigh Syndrome, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. This may include medications to control seizures, breathing support, and physical therapy. In some cases, dietary changes may also be recommended to help support energy production in the body (Leigh Syndrome Foundation, n.d.).
